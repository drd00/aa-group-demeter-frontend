# Adaptive Applications Group Demeter Programming Project
This is the repository for the Adaptive Applications group Demeter, using ReactJS. More specific details will be added here once an application idea has been decided upon.

## Setting it up
There is a page in the repository wiki with instructions on setting everything up, including Firebase authentication. In short, `npm install` and `npm run dev` will install the necessary packages on your local machine and run the development server respectively.

## Noteworthy packages used
This project uses Recoil for managing global application state, a combination of TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for styling and Google Firebase for user authentication.
